# 586. Customer Placing the Largest Number of Orders(Easy)
Table: Orders  
```
+-----------------+----------+
| Column Name     | Type     |
+-----------------+----------+
| order_number    | int      |
| customer_number | int      |
+-----------------+----------+  
order_number is the primary key for this table.
This table contains information about the order ID and the customer ID.
```
Write an SQL query to find the customer_number for the customer who has placed the largest number of orders.

The test cases are generated so that exactly one customer will have placed more orders than any other customer.

The query result format is in the following example.

Example 1:
```
Input: 
Orders table:
+--------------+-----------------+
| order_number | customer_number |
+--------------+-----------------+
| 1            | 1               |
| 2            | 2               |
| 3            | 3               |
| 4            | 3               |
+--------------+-----------------+
Output: 
+-----------------+
| customer_number |
+-----------------+
| 3               |
+-----------------+
Explanation: 
The customer with number 3 has two orders, which is greater than either customer 1 or 2 because each of them only has one order. 
So the result is customer_number 3.

Follow up: What if more than one customer has the largest number of orders, can you find all the customer_number in this case?
```
Approach: Using LIMIT [Accepted]
```
SELECT customer_number
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_number
ORDER BY count(order_number) DESC LIMIT 1;
```

# 603. Consecutive Available Seats(Easy)
Table: Cinema  
```
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| seat_id     | int  |
| free        | bool |
+-------------+------+
seat_id is an auto-increment primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table indicates whether the ith seat is free or not. 1 means free while 0 means occupied.
```
Write an SQL query to report all the consecutive available seats in the cinema.

Return the result table ordered by seat_id in ascending order.

The test cases are generated so that more than two seats are consecutively available.

The query result format is in the following example.

Example 1:
```
Input: 
Cinema table:
+---------+------+
| seat_id | free |
+---------+------+
| 1       | 1    |
| 2       | 0    |
| 3       | 1    |
| 4       | 1    |
| 5       | 1    |
+---------+------+
Output: 
+---------+
| seat_id |
+---------+
| 3       |
| 4       |
| 5       |
+---------+
```
Approach: Using self join and abs()[Accepted]  
```
SELECT DISTINCT a.seat_id
FROM Cinema a
JOIN Cinema b ON abs(a.seat_id - b.seat_id) = 1
AND a.free = 1
AND b.free = 1
ORDER BY seat_id;
```

+------+
Explanation: 
According to orders 3 and 4 in the Orders table, it is easy to tell that only salesperson John and Pam have sales to company RED, so we report all the other names in the table salesperson.

Approach: Using JOIN and NOT IN [Accepted]
```
SELECT name
FROM SalesPerson
WHERE sales_id NOT IN
    (SELECT DISTINCT o.sales_id
     FROM Orders o
     JOIN Company c ON o.com_id = c.com_id
     WHERE c.name = 'RED')
